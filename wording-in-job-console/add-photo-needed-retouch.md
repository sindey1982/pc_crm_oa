Clicking the  button to choose one raw files , in additionly you can add note for this raw photo. The most important reason to choose  uploading one photo one time is that makes the conmunications for retouching more clearly and more precisely. 

Don't forget to click upload button to start uploading after choosing file you want to upload . becase raw file  is large usually, so  you can assert  the file rather than canceling after upload  starting which may case a few fragments on ther server. this my be improved in the future by you advice.
